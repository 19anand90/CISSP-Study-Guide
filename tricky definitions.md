* RTO - recovery time objective: the amount of time expected to return an IT service to operation after failure
* MTD - maximum tolerable down time: longest amount of time that an IT service may be unavailable without causing serious damage
* SLA - service level agreement: written contracts that document service expectations
* Device finger printing via web portal - requires user authentication and gather lots of data to uniquely identify devices
* Data owner - responsible for classification of data
* pulverizing - best way to comply remove data so that it doesn't leak 
* TACAS+ - cisco proprietary protocol. Improvement of radius
