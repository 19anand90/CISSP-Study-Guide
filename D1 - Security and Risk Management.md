### Understand and apply concepts of confidentiality, integrity and availability
#### Definitions and examples
* Confidentiality - Making sure the right people can access the material.  Data must be classified so the administrators knows exactly who should have access.  Users must Identify themselves, authenticate, and then be given authorization before having access.  Contents must be encrypted or restricted for users who don't do the above.
  * End to End symetric encryption holds confidentiality because only users with a key can see the data
  * File permissions only allow authorized users to view the contents
* Integrity - Protected from changes
  * Hashing
  * Segregation of duties
  * approval checkpoints (SDLC)
  * RSA(uses HMC)
  * IPSec
* Availability - Information is available to users when they need it
  * Not vulnerable to DOS
  * Has backups and redundancy to ensure no downtime
  
#### How do they relate to each other?

### Evaluate and apply security governance principles
##### English please?? - These are just defined roles, and processes for each role, to make sure executive management is informed about IT decisions being made.  This makes sure that information is appropriately secured, communicated, documented, and budgeted for.  It's like a questionaire.  Look at ISO 27000 to get requimrents for which security frameworks you should impliment.  Think of security frameworks as blue prints and governance principles(iso 27000 or togaf) as guides for how to draw blueprints.
* Alignment of security function to business strategy, goals, mission, and objectives
  * Have to analyze cost of loss/thieft information, cost to impliment controls, and the benefit to organization by certain controls.
* Organizational processes (e.g., acquisitions, divestitures, governance committees)
  * if the business changes at all, security needs to be involved in that changing process. apply frameworks to those processes.
* Organizational roles and responsibilities
  * different job titles have to work with others and be aware of things.  each job has a checklist of things to be concerend about.  some positions will be reponsible for risk on certain decisions.
* Security control frameworks
  * the blue prints to how security in the organization is done.  ex. if you are going to label an area on a blueprint as a "bed room", it needs to meet certain requirements. certain frameworks need to be applied to your organization based off what you contain.
* Due care/due diligence
  *  legal perspective. What would a "reasonable person" due in the same circumstance if they were being responsible?
