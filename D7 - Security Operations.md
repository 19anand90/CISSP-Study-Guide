# Understand and support investigations, Evidence collection, and handling
This is pretty generic.  Make sure you confirm something is a problem before taking any actions.  If something needs to be acted upon, contain it first(unplug ethernet or put up crime scene tape), and use procedures (write blocks or gloves to keep integrity of the object you are assessing).  Forensics focuses on the legality of conducting an investigation.
* Reporting and documentation
* Investigative techniques
* Digital forensics tools, tactics, and procedures


# Understand requirements for investigation types
I've never seen these questions asked in practice tests so I wouldn't worry about them.  They are also not covered in the 2 different CISSP books I have...
* Administrative 
* Criminal
* Civil 
* Regulatory 
* Industry standards

# Conduct logging and monitoring activities
* Intrusion detection and prevention - detections looks for actions and reports, while prevention takes action.  There are network based and host based.
* Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) - Security Information and Event Management.  Most should provide traffic analysis, analyze logs, scan the network with a vulnerability scanner, and report actions/info via email, phone, etc.
* Continuous monitoring - this is a strategy.  NIST 800-137 provides a plan for implimenting continuous monitoring that provides visibility of assets, awarness of threats/vulns, and security controls deployed.
* Egress monitoring - monitoring traffic leaving your network

# Securely provisioning resources
* Asset inventory - tracking: hardware, software, programs installed
* Asset management - updating software, replacing hardware, adding functionality, removing functionality, tracking their location
* Configuration management - process of establishing and maintaining consistent baselines of all of the systems.  get baselines of everything

# Understand and apply foundational security operations concepts
* Need-to-know/least privileges - A user should have a need to know to access particular resources, and least privilege should be implemented to ensure she only accesses the resources she has a need to know.
* Separation of duties and responsibilities - Separation of duties is put into place to ensure that one entity cannot carry out a critical task alone.
* Privileged account management - privilege kreep tends to happen over time. need to ensure there is great justification always to have administrative privileges.  administrative actions are logged.
* Job rotation - Rotation of duties enables a company to have more than one person trained in a position and can uncover fraudulent activities
* Information lifecycle - flow of information. overtime information becomes less useful and less sensitive. if someone stole your credit card info for your current one it would be bad, but one you had 15 years ago wouldn't really matter that much.
* Service Level Agreements (SLA) - helps decide what type of availability technology is appropriate.

# Apply resource protection techniques
* Media management
* Hardware and software asset management
