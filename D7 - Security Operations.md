# Understand and support investigations, Evidence collection, and handling
This is pretty generic.  Make sure you confirm something is a problem before taking any actions.  If something needs to be acted upon, contain it first(unplug ethernet or put up crime scene tape), and use procedures (write blocks or gloves to keep integrity of the object you are assessing).  Forensics focuses on the legality of conducting an investigation.
* Reporting and documentation
* Investigative techniques
* Digital forensics tools, tactics, and procedures


# Understand requirements for investigation types
I've never seen these questions asked in practice tests so I wouldn't worry about them.  They are also not covered in the 2 different CISSP books I have...
* Administrative 
* Criminal
* Civil 
* Regulatory 
* Industry standards

# Conduct logging and monitoring activities
* Intrusion detection and prevention - detections looks for actions and reports, while prevention takes action.  There are network based and host based.
* Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) - Security Information and Event Management.  Most should provide traffic analysis, analyze logs, scan the network with a vulnerability scanner, and report actions/info via email, phone, etc.
* Continuous monitoring - this is a strategy.  NIST 800-137 provides a plan for implimenting continuous monitoring that provides visibility of assets, awarness of threats/vulns, and security controls deployed.
* Egress monitoring - monitoring traffic leaving your network

# Securely provisioning resources
* Asset inventory - 
* Asset management - 
* Configuration management - 

# Understand and apply foundational security operations concepts
* Need-to-know/least privileges
* Separation of duties and responsibilities
