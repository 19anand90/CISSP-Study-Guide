### Control physical and logical access to assets
Access is controled by setting up rules and procedures for access.  If you are going to use the object, there should only be one/two ways to get to it.  You must confirm someones identitiy by having them prove: Something they know, something they have, or something they are.
* Information
* Systems
* Devices
* Facilities

### Manage identification and authentication of people, devices, and services
* Identity management implementation 
* Single/multi-factor authentication - in multi-factor authentication, you must provide two of three different forms of identity
* Accountability - beng able to audit a system and demonstrate the actions of subjects
* Session management - providing the user some type of token that they use to acquire resources and identity them with.  They don't need to re-authenticate everytime they want to access something
* Registration and proofing of identity - when signing up for a service you may be asked for PII, personal questions about your pas that would be difficult for other to figure out, and information that is unique to you like your email.
* Federated Identity Management (FIM) - setup a trust relationship between two companies so they can share authentication information
* Credential management systems - keeps passwords encrypted and safe from unauthorized access.  allows passwords services read permissions to the hashes that need to authenticate someones password

### Integrate identity as a third-party service
* On-premise - 
* Cloud - 
* Federated - 

### Implement and manage authorization mechanisms
* Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Rule-based access control
* Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
* Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
* Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)

### Manage the identity and access provisioning lifecycle
* User access review
* System account access review
* Provisioning and deprovisioning

### Definition of Existing Services
* SSO - 
* Directory services - 
* Active Directory - 
* CA - 
* LDAP - 
* SAML - 
* OAUTH - 
* Kerberos - 
* One time pad - 
* RADIUS - 
* TACACS - 
* Biometrics -
