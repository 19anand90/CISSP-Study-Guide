### Implement and manage engineering processes using secure design principles
### Understand the fundamental concepts of security models
### Select controls based upon systems security requirements
### Understand security capabilities of information systems (e.g., memory protection, Trusted
* Platform Module (TPM), encryption/decryption)
### Assess and mitigate the vulnerabilities of security architectures, designs, and solution elements
* Client-based systems
* Server-based systems
* Database systems
* Cryptographic systems
* Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
* Cloud-based systems
* Distributed systems
* Internet of Things (IoT)

### Assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in web-based systems

### Assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in mobile systems

### Assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in embedded devices

### Apply cryptography
* Cryptographic life cycle (e.g., key management,
algorithm selection)
* Cryptographic methods (e.g., symmetric,
asymmetric, elliptic curves)
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
* Key management practices
* Digital signatures
* Non-repudiation
* Integrity (e.g., hashing)
* Understand methods of cryptanalytic attacks
* Digital Rights Management (DRM)

### Apply security principles to site and facility design

### Implement site and facility security controls
* Wiring closets/intermediate distribution facilities
* Server rooms/data centers
* Media storage facilities
* Evidence storage
* Restricted and work area security
* Utilities and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
* Environmental issues
* Fire prevention, detection, and suppression
