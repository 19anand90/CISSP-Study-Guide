### Implement and manage engineering processes using secure design principles
Designing and managing secure computer systems breaks out into 4 layers: hardware, kernel and device drivers, operating system, applications.  Perimeter defenses is physical security.  There should be multiple layers of defense at each component that needs to be protected.

### Understand the fundamental concepts of security models
* Access control and least privilege - Bella-lapadula model
* Complex environments - Lattice-based access control
* Integirty - Biba Model, Clark-Wilson
* Conflict of Interest - Chinese Wall Model

### Select controls based upon systems security requirements
[NIST document for selecing controls](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Risk-Management/documents/select/faq-Select-step2.pdf)
Generally a framework is used to categorize the information system or business, and then it will tell you which controls or standards are applicable.

### Understand security capabilities of information systems (e.g., memory protection, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), encryption/decryption)
* Access control - ring model is used.  Ring 3 is user, ring 0 is Kernel.
* Memory Protection - prevents a program from affecting the integrity, availability, and confidentiality from another
* TPM - a processor at harware level that allows computer to do cryptographic operations.  If TPM, can do secure boot and full disk encryption
* Encryption - can provide confidentiality and integrity depending on type of cryptography used

### Assess and mitigate the vulnerabilities of security architectures, designs, and solution elements
* Client-based systems
* Server-based systems
* Database systems
* Cryptographic systems
* Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
* Cloud-based systems
* Distributed systems
* Internet of Things (IoT)

### Assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in web-based systems

### Assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in mobile systems

### Assess and mitigate vulnerabilities in embedded devices

### Apply cryptography
* Cryptographic life cycle (e.g., key management,
algorithm selection)
* Cryptographic methods (e.g., symmetric,
asymmetric, elliptic curves)
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
* Key management practices
* Digital signatures
* Non-repudiation
* Integrity (e.g., hashing)
* Understand methods of cryptanalytic attacks
* Digital Rights Management (DRM)

### Apply security principles to site and facility design

### Implement site and facility security controls
* Wiring closets/intermediate distribution facilities
* Server rooms/data centers
* Media storage facilities
* Evidence storage
* Restricted and work area security
* Utilities and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
* Environmental issues
* Fire prevention, detection, and suppression
